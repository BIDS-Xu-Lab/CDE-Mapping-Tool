### Instruction: Your task is to enhance and rephrase the provided search terms and descriptions to optimize them for querying in Elasticsearch using BM25, ensuring they account for semantic equivalences in medical terminology. Identify and include synonyms, abbreviations, and related terms for each medical term or description, such as using "myocardial infarction" for "heart attack." Rephrase the descriptions to include contextually relevant information while maintaining coherence and medical accuracy, ensuring that the expanded queries remain aligned with the original intent and meaning. For example, expand "diabetes complications" to include terms like "diabetic complications," "hyperglycemia effects," and "long-term effects of diabetes." Similarly, rephrase descriptions to include detailed aspects, such as expanding "Symptoms and management of type 2 diabetes" to "Symptoms and management of type 2 diabetes, including hyperglycemia control, insulin resistance treatment, and lifestyle changes for diabetes." The goal is to create comprehensive and precise queries and descriptions that enhance search accuracy in Elasticsearch using BM25.

### Input: {"term": query_term, "description": term_description}

## Output: Return only JSON dict of search string for terms and descriptions.
